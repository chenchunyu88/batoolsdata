# Information about the dataset

The data comes from https://github.com/steibelj/gwaR, an example dataset for gwas study for MSUPRP dataset. The complete dataset can be also found at https://github.com/steibelj/GWA_growth.

The dataset comes as `gpData` from the `synbreed` R package.

This example will demonstrate how to create pedigree based relationship matrix and adaptive window based LD from the dataset.

Finally, we'll create the data file for BATools.

### 0. Before you start
Make sure you have the following R package installed: `dplyr`,`MCMCglmm`, `Matrix`


### 1. Explore the data 

```{r}
load("MSUPRP_sample.RData")
class(MSUPRP_sample)
str(MSUPRP_sample)
```

### 2. Merge phenotype and covar to a dataframe
Commonly, using dataframe or datatable to manage all phenotypes are easier. So we'll merge the two together
```{r}
library(dplyr)
tmp<-data.frame(MSUPRP_sample$pheno)
tmp$id<-rownames(tmp)
colnames(tmp)=c("ph_24h"," temp_24h","driploss","id")
pheno<-left_join(tmp,MSUPRP_sample$covar,by="id")
head(pheno)
```


### 3. Check genotype matrix
```{r}
geno<-MSUPRP_sample$geno
dim(geno)
geno[1:5,1:10]
```

In BATools, the `id` will be matched with the `colname` of the genotype matrix, make sure you have genotype for all the individuals unless you're using single-step approach.

```{r}
genof0<-geno[which(as.numeric(rownames(geno))>6000),]
dim(genof0)
maf.f0<-colMeans(genof0,na.rm = T)/2
summary(maf.f0)
```


### 4. Create pedigree based additive genomic relationship matrix
```{r}
ped<-MSUPRP_sample$pedigree
head(ped)
```

```{r}
source("tools.R")
library(pedigree)
colnames(ped)=c("id","father","mother","generation","sex")
ped0=Pedigree(ped,unknown = 0)
Ainv<-MCMCglmm::inverseA(pedigree=ped0[,1:3],nodes="ALL")$Ainv
A=Matrix::solve(Ainv,sparse=TRUE,tol=1e-16)
A[which(A<1e-6)]=0
colnames(A)=rownames(A)=ped0$id
A
```


### Building map with adaptive window based on LD
```{r}
map<-MSUPRP_sample$map
head(map)
```

Install `BALD` package from http://www.math-evry.cnrs.fr/logiciels/bald. On windows, `RTools` need to be pre-installed https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/ and add your `RTools` path to enviroment variable. But linux or Mac are recommended since `BALD` is not available at CRAN. 

Installing these packages can be complicated, if you have any question, send me an email at chench57{at}msu.edu

```{r}
source("https://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
biocLite("chopsticks")
biocLite("snpStats")
biocLite("ROC")
install.packages(c("LDheatmap","quadrupen", "ROC", "grplasso","snpStats"))
system("wget http://www.math-evry.cnrs.fr/_media/logiciels/bald_0.2.1.tar.gz")
system("R CMD INSTALL bald_0.2.1.tar.gz")
```

Ok, now we can start to use BALD for obtain the LD based window
```{r}
library(BALD)
map=MSUPRP_sample$map
chrs=list()
for(i in 1:max(map$chr)){
  ii=which(map$chr==i)
  chrs[[i]]=geno[,ii]
}

#This will take couple hours, suggest you run it in parallel in high-performance computing (HPC) platform, which was what I did. 
for(i in 1:length(chrs)){
  Z=chr[[i]]+1
  p=dim(Z)[2]
  gapS <- gapStatistic(Z, min.nc=2, max.nc=p-1, B=50)
  gapS$best.k
  adaptiveWindows[[i]] <- cutree(gapS$tree, gapS$best.k)
}

#After running this througth, I save the file in `bald.RData`
```

Let's then re-load the file we computed on HPC
